# Text Transformation Tool

This is a **React-based Text Transformation Tool** that allows users to transform, manipulate, and interact with text in various ways. The app includes features like **Uppercase/Lowercase conversion**, **Grammar checking**, **Text translation**, **Speech synthesis**, **Voice recognition**, and more. The tool also provides a **Recycle Bin** to store recently deleted texts and allows users to **clear** the text or copy it to the clipboard.

     - `Convert to Lowercase`

### 2. **Grammar Check**
   - **Check the grammar** of the text using the **TextGears API**.
   - If any grammatical errors are found, the app will show the errors in a friendly format.
